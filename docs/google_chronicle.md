# Google Chronicle
Google Chronicle is one of Google's acquistions to get into the security market, focused on Search and Detection of malicious behavior.

## Authentication
As with all apps, you need to get started with Authentication. For Chronicle, like with a lot of Google services, it requires constant re-authentication to avoid using expired tokens.

1. Get a credential file from Google
2. Upload it to Gsoc2's [File Storage](https://soc2.khulnasoft.com/admin?tab=files)
3. In a workflow, find the "Get JWT from file" action in the Gsoc2 Tools app

5. The JWT generated in step 3 can now be used in Google Chronicle's "Api-key"
