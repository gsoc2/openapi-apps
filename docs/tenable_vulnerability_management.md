## Authentication
- Tenable.io generates a unique set of API keys for each user account. We need  X-ApiKeys for authentication.
    #### To generate API keys for your own account :
    - Login into https://cloud.tenable.com/#/ 
    - Go to https://cloud.tenable.com/tio/app.html#/settings/my-account/api-keys 
    - Click on Generate *(**Caution**: Any existing API keys are replaced when you click the Generate button. You must update the applications where the previous API keys were used.)*
    - Copy the new access and secret keys to a safe location. *(**Caution**: Be sure to copy the access and secret keys before you close the API Keys tab. After you close this tab, you cannot retrieve the keys.)*
    
    #### Authentication in Gsoc2:
    - In Apikey parameter you need to enter the access and secret key in the following **format**:
        - accessKey=ACCESS_KEY; secretKey=SECRET_KEY;
        - **Example**:accessKey=d95e12bcd59c6725823f3f84ea588bb46846447f8037b6e211d1c5e21bbbf847; secretKey=ae66a1r7761fb67da8b91bd7f8aea1e9de1cc38f40feb67cd920e93a5913a2ef
