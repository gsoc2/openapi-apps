### Authentication

This topic describes the API authentication method for Imperva SaaS products.

In order to use the API, the client must be authenticated by Imperva. To authenticate, send your API ID and API key using the x-API-Id and x-API-Key request headers. For example:

```
x-API-Id: 12345

x-API-Key: 123**************789
```
 

To create and manage API keys with granular permissions and sub account access, see API Key Management.

The API functionality available for your use is based on the roles and permissions assigned to your user. Use of the API does not require additional permissions beyond that.
